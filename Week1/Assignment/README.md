# Week 1 Assignment – HTML & CSS Basics

Welcome to your first Trackathon assignment. This is where we begin our web dev journey — with a good ol’ **personal profile page**, built using nothing but raw HTML and CSS.  
No JavaScript, no frameworks, just the building blocks. It’s like learning to cook before opening a restaurant.

## 🎯 What You’re Building

Create a **Profile Page** using only **HTML** and **CSS**.

This isn’t your LinkedIn profile — we want to see a bit of personality. Include the following information:

### 📄 Profile Details (7 fields required)

1. **Full Name** – So we know what to call you (besides “developer”)
2. **Profile Picture** – Not mandatory, but show us the face behind the bugs
3. **Favorite Foods** – We’re judging your taste, silently
4. **Hobbies** – Even the weird ones (especially the weird ones)
5. **Education** – Tell us where you see yourself when GitHub Copilot fully takes over
6. **Your Tech Stack (so far)** – Even if it's just HTML and CSS, own it
7. **Fun Fact About You** – Example: “I once pushed to main on the first try” (we won’t believe you)

## 💡 Learning Outcomes

By completing this task, you’ll practice:

- Writing semantic HTML (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc.)
- Using `<ul>`, `<img>`, `<a>`, and more with purpose
- Structuring a clean and readable layout with CSS
- Organizing your project properly with external `.css` file
- Gaining confidence that yes, you can center a `<div>` eventually

## 🧱 Starter Template

Your folder should look like this:
```
week-1/
├── index.html
└── styles.css
```

---

Don’t overdo it — clean and readable > fancy and broken.

---

## ✅ Submission Checklist

- No expectations, Just try to add css as much as you can for styling

---

## 🚨 Final Reminder

> Don’t worry if it’s not perfect — the goal is to learn by doing.  
> Break it, fix it, Google it, try again. That’s the developer way.

Now go build a profile page worth bragging about.
